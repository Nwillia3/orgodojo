              • Alkenes can assume two stereoisomeric configurations: cis and
              trans.<br />
              • When the groups are opposite we denote the alkene as trans and
              then they are on the same side the groups are cis to each other.
              Note the distinct shape of both stereoisomers.<br />
              • Trans is more stable than cis because steric hindrance is
              minimized within the molecule. There is less electron repulsion
              between the two trans substituents. <br />
              <img src="../images/ch502-E-Z Alkenes.png", size: "300x160",
              class: "center-img" > <br />
              • When there are multiple complex functional groups on an alkene
              we use the E-Z notation.<br />
              • If the dominate groups are opposite each other use E before the
              name and if they are on the same side we use Z before the molecule
              name.<br />
              • To use E-Z notation, start at the sp2 carbon of the double bond,
              move outward, and compare the substituents on each carbon.<br />
              • Compare the carbons by atomic number until there is a point of
              difference. The substituent that has the greater atomic number is
              the dominate group.<br />

              beta-hydride elimination reaction.<br />
              • Alcohols in the presence of heat and acid will generate alkenes
              via dehydration.<br />
              • H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> can also be used as well as other
              strong acids.<br />
              • This reaction follows an E1 mechanism.<br />

              • In the presence of other functional groups the major product is
              formed at the most substituted position. This is called Zaitsev’s
              Rule.

              • This is the E1 mechanism for alcohol dehydration. Notice that it
              has a carbocation intermediate as the product of step two. This is
              also the slow step of the reaction.<br />
              • In this pathway hydride or methyl shifts can occur in order to
              achieve a more stable carbocation intermediate.<br />

              create double bonds via dehydration. A strong base (one with a
              negative charge) and its conjugate acid are necessary for this
              type of reaction.<br />
              • This reaction follows an E2 mechanism.<br />
              • In cyclohexane molecules the halogen and proton to be abstracted
              must be in the trans configuration. To achieve this ring
              interconversions might be needed.<br />

            <h4 class="emphasis">Reactivity</h4>
            <p>
              • Rate of dehydration by leaving group: (fastest) RI > RBr > RCl
              >> RF (Slowest)<br />
              • RI proceeds the fastest because it has a weak carbon-iodide bond
              due to the large size of iodide.<br />

            <h4 class="emphasis">Regioselecitivty</h4>

              concerted one step reaction. The reaction is bimolecular because
              two species are involved in the slow step: the base and the
              halogen.
