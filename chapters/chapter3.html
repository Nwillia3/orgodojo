                • Alkanes can be viewed from different angles. Below are several
                3D orientations for ethane.<br />
                <img src="../images/ch301-Sawhorse-Newman Drawings.png", size:
                "380x230", class: "center-img" > <br />• As we rotate ethane (1)
                and lay the molecule flat (2) hydrogen atoms rearrange
                themselves (3) to prevent crowding or to alleviate torsional
                strain.<br />
                • If we continue to rotate ethane (4) until we look at the
                carbons head on we get to (5). To better visualize the carbons
                located in the front and back, we redraw the molecule to look
                like (6).<br />
                • Representation #3 is called a sawhorse drawing.<br />
                • Representation #6 is called a Newman projection. A point
                represents the front carbon and the circle represents the back
                carbon.<br />
                • These representations are used to understand how atoms on a
                molecule orient themselves in space.<br />

                • Molecules as simple as ethane and butane help us understand
                the distinct conformations that arise as we encounter higher
                numbered alkanes.<br />
                • Alkanes with more than one carbon can have two distinct
                conformations: staggered and eclipsed.<br />

                "340x140", class: "center-img" > <br />
                • Here we see the two conformations of butane along the C2-C3
                bond.<br />
                • Methyl groups rotated 0° relative to each other exist in the
                syn conformation (left).<br />
                • Methyl groups rotated 180° relative to each other exist in the
                anti conformation (center).<br />
                • Methyl groups rotated 60° relative to each other exist in the
                gauche conformation (right).<br />
                • The staggered conformations are more stable than eclipsed
                therefore all molecules exist as a staggered variants.<br />

              <p>
                • Cyclohexane has a couple of interesting conformational
                structures.<br />
                <img src="../images/ch303-representations of cyclohexane.png"

                <br />
                • The center figure is called the chair conformation. This is
                its most stable conformation.<br />
                • Since carbon has a tetrahedral molecular shape when bonded to
                four other species, the chair conformation has two other
                plains.<br />

                <img src="../images/ch304-axial-cyclohexane.png" size: "310x120"
                class: "center-img" >
                <br />• The bonds drawn at the labeled carbons are in the axial
                position. There we have axial hydrogens.<br />
                • As we draw the rest of the axial bonds we must take care to
                alternate the bonds above and below the ring to alleviate
                torsional strain.<br />
                <img src="../images/ch305-equatorial-cyclohexane.png", size:
                "280x100", class: "center-img" > <br />• The same method must be
                applied for the equatorial bonds.<br />
                • Now all we need to do is add some substituents.<br />
                <img src="../images/ch306-cyclohexane and substituents.png",
                size: "150x90", class: "center-img" > <br />• The methyl and
                ethyl group are pretty bulky compared to hydrogen. Their axial
                position causes some strain on the molecules stability.<br />
                • Cyclohexane molecules often have undergo chair-chair
                interconversions to which converts all axial bonds to equatorial
                bonds and vice-versa to achieve a more stable chair
                conformation.<br />
                <img src="../images/ch307-chair-interconversions.png", size:
                "320x120", class: "center-img" > <br />• The bulkier groups
                prefer to be equatorial.<br />

            <div class="collapsible-body">
              <p>
                • Stereoisomers are molecules that have their bond connectivity
                in the same order but their spatial arrangement is different.<br />
                <img src="../images/ch308-cis-and-trans.png", size: "230x110",
                class: "center-img" > <br />
                • The left figure has methyl groups on the same side to we say
                they are cis.<br />
                • The methyl groups on the right figure on the opposite side so
                they are trans.<br />
                <img src="../images/ch306-cyclohexane and substituents.png",
                size: "150x90", class: "center-img" > <br />
                • In cyclohexane, the methyl and ethyl groups have a cis
                relationship because they are on the same side of the ring
                molecule.<br />
                • The relationship between methyl and hydrogen is trans because
                they are on opposite sides of the ring.<br />
                • In many case trans is the more stable conformation because the
                molecules are not under any torsional strain.<br />
