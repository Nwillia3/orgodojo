              • Below we can see two molecules: one with an alcohol group (left)
              and the other an alkyl bromide group (right).<br />

              • The alcohol on 2-propanol is characterized a secondary alcohol
              because the carbon bonded to the alcohol is also bonded to two
              other carbons.<br />
              • The 1-Bromopentane compounds on the right is described as a
              primary bromide because the carbon bonded to bromine is bonded to
              one other carbon.<br />
              • Alcohols can have up to three degrees of substitutions.<br />

              • Alkyl halides also have the same degree of substitution pattern
              because they are derived from alcohols.<br />

              good base.<br />

              • To make alkyl halides we react alcohols with a halide acid (HI,
              HBr, or HCl). This is called a unimolecular nucleophilic
              substitution (SN1) reaction.<br />
              • This SN1 reaction generates an alkyl halide that serves as good
              leaving group for subsequent reactions.<br />
            </p>

            <h4 class="emphasis">Rectivity</h4>
            <p>
              • Alcohol Substitution: (fastest) 3° > 2° > 1° alcohols
              (slowest)<br />
              • Use of Acid: (fastest) HI > HBr > HCl >> HF (slowest); HF is not
              used because of its high electronegativity which means the
              electrons are not donated during the reaction.<br />
              • Leaving group displacement: (best) R-I > R-Br > R-Cl >>> R-F
              (worst)<br />
              • Alkyl iodides are the better leaving group here.<br />
            </p>

            <p>
              • The transition state is controlled by the carbocation in step
              two. This is the rate determining step of the reaction or the slow
              step. The rate law for the slow step is modeled by: rate =
              k[R-LG]<br />
              • By this equation we can see how the reaction is unimolecular by
              nature. The rate is affected by the amount of R-LG reactant.<br />
            </p>

            <h4 class="emphasis">Carbocation Stability</h4>

              class: "center-img" > <br />

              • The stability of the reaction relies on the cabocation
              transition state.<br />
              • The reason why this is called a unimolecular substitution
              reaction is because only one species is involved in the formation
              of the product once we’ve reached the transition state: the
              carbocaton.<br />
              • A more stable carbocation results in a faster reaction.<br />
              • Carbocations can also undergo rearrangements in order to form a
              more stable carbocation as detailed below.<br />
              <img src="../images/ch408-1,2 Hydride Shift.png", size: "400x140",
              class: "center-img" > <br />• Once we reach the transition state,
              the molecule can undergo a hydride migration to achieve as more
              stable carbocation. Methyl groups can also undergo these 1,2
              shifts.

              class: "center-img" > • Step two of the SN2 reaction is the rate
              determining step. This is a concerted step. A bromide ion attacks
              the carbon and simultaneously displaces the water leaving
              group.<br />
              • Since two species are involved in the rate-determining step this
              reaction is bimolecular.<br />
              • This stereochemistry is inverted because the nucleophilic
              bromide attacks the carbon from the side opposite of the water
              leaving group.<br />
              • The rate law can be modeled by: rate = k[Br-][R-OH]
