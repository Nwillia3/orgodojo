                We beleive familiarity builds confidence. We believe simple and
                straightforward lessons are most effective. We consolidate all
                the resources you need one place so you do not have to distract
                yourself with endless Google searches. We believe that
                strengthening fundamentals are at the core of student success in
                the classroom.

                Chapters 1 thru 3 are an overview of the genercal chemistry
                concepts you will encounter in organic chemistry.<br />
                Chapters 4 thru 22 focus on the heart of organic chemistry:
                reactions and mechanism. There will also be some lab specific
                resources avalible help along the way.

                A recurring theme that we see in organic chemistry is that
                molecular structure determines the chemical properties and
                behaviors of molecule or compound. Remember this theme as we
                review basic general chemistry and move into organic chemistry:
                molecular structure determines chemical property. Familiarity
                builds confidence!

                • Atoms are the collection of a subatomic particles found in all
                matter.<br />
                • These subatomic particles are called protons, neutrons, and
                electrons.<br />
                • Each one has a charge: Protons (+1), neutrons (0), and
                electrons (-1).<br />
                • Electrons are located in orbitals: regions in 3D space outside
                the atomic nucleus.<br />
                • Orbitals can have different names, shapes and properties. The
                s and p orbitals will be most relevant.<br />
                • Orbital, which also includes electrons, are used in chemical
                bonding.<br />
                • S orbitals bond or overlap head-on along the internuclear
                axis.<br />
                • P orbitals overlap above and below the internuclear axis.

                • There are two major bonds: ionic and covalent.<br />
                • Ionic bonds involve charged species or ions. These bonds
                occurs when on elemental species donates electrons to another
                species to form charged molecules. Ex: NaCl<br />
                • Covalent bonds occur when two species share electrons
                pairs.<br />
                Covalent bonds can be triple, double, or single bonds.<br />
                • The atom and dot representation of covalent bonds are called
                Lewis structures.<br />
                • Covalent bonds are formed so each atom has a complete octet or
                8 electrons with some atoms serving as exceptions: Helium,
                Hydrogen, and Boron.

                • The possible resonance structures for diazomethaneare is shown
                below. <img src='../images/ch101-diazomethaneare-resonance.png'
                , size: "340x108", class: "center-img" > <br />• Resonance
                structures are molecules that have more than one correct Lewis
                structure. The true structure is called a resonance hybrid.
                <br />
                • These structures are obtained by moving electrons. <img
                src="../images/ch102-resonance-arrows.png" , size: "340x108",

                <br />
                • A curved arrow is used to indicate the direction of electron
                motion.<br />
                • Electrons are moved so that the octet rule can be obeyed in
                the new Lewis structure.<br />
                • As you can see above the delocalization (or movement) of
                electron causes each atom to gain a new relative charge based on
                the electron distribution called a formal charge.<br />
                • To determine the formal charge of each atom we use the
                formula: FC = # of valence electrons - # of assigned valence
                electron<br />
                • Where the number of assigned valence electrons are the
                electrons that are donated by that atom for form a covalent
                bond.<br />
                • When a molecule has multiple Lewis structures, the preferred
                structure will be the one with minimized formal charges or will
                have the negative charge on the most electronegative atom.<br />
                • Based on the electron distribution the molecule can have a
                dipole moment.<br />
                • Dipole moments is the net direction of the polarity within a
                molecule.<br />
                • Dipoles exist in molecules with atoms of different
                electronegativity values.<br />
                • Think of vector additions from physics when working out these
                problems<br />

                • Remember that the number of bonds to a central atom often
                results in a specific 3D orientation.<br />

                hybridizations. Keep them at the back for your head. These

                exams with time to spare. <img

                vertices and hides the hydrogen atom.<br />
                • This representation is called the bond line formula.<br />
                • Vertices represent carbon atoms. If no other atoms are shown
                then draw hydrogen bonds to each carbon until the octet rule is
                obeyed. Ex: Terminal single bonded carbons in pentane are bonded
                to 3 hydrogen atoms.
